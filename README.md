## Packages and Libraries we are using 

### For components we are using Charka UI

[Charka UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
is a component library that is very popular among
developers. It is a set of components that are designed to be
used together, and make it easier to style components so we
can focus out time on features of our application rather then
stlying.
